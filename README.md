# Snake-ladders
- Here is a digital version of the good ol' game of Snakes and Ladders! Compete with friends, set new records and relive your childhood again.
- The whole game is made in python and python's turtle module.

# How to Play ?
The gameplay is very simple to understand. Just use the button, to roll the dice. Your piece will move automatically, wait for your turn, roll the dice again and again till you beat your opponent!

# Technology Stack :
The entire code has been written in Python3 and I've used python's Turtle module for creating all the GUI elements.
