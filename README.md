# Snake-ladders
- Here is a digital version of the good ol' game of Snakes and Ladders! Compete with friends, set new records and relive your childhood again.
- The whole game is made in python and python's turtle module.

# How to Play ?
- The gameplay is very simple to understand. Just use the button, to roll the dice. Your piece will move automatically, wait for your turn, roll the dice again and again till you beat your opponent!
- You can play the game by just running "main.py" . But it requires "python" and "turtle" to be installed on your system . To install turtle just enter
pip install turtle on cmd/terminal.
- WARNING: Don't delete any of the files and always keep the data folder in the same folder as of "main.py". Else the code will give errors and the game will not start .

# Technology Stack :
The entire code has been written in Python3 and I've used python's Turtle module for creating all the GUI elements.
